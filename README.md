## Mars Webscraping 

## The goal of the project was to:
    1. Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
    2. Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

    
## Part 1: Mars News Scraping
    1. Used automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site.
    2. Created a Beautiful Soup object to parse the HTML content.
    3. Extracted the titles and preview text of the news articles.
    4. Stored the scraping results in a list of dictionaries with 'title' and 'preview' keys.
    5. Printed the list in the Jupyter Notebook.
    6. Optionally, stored the scraped data in a JSON file for easier sharing.

    
## Part 2: Mars Weather Data Scraping and Analysis
    1. Used automated browsing with Splinter to visi the Mars Temperature Data Site.
    2. Created a Beautiful Soup object to scrape the data in the HTML table.
    3. Assembled the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate column headings.
    4. Examined and cast the data types to appropriate datetime, int, or float data types if necessary.
    5. Analyzed the dataset to answer questions related to Martian months, days, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
    6. Visualized the results using bar charts and line plots.
    7. Exported the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## Conclusion
    We were able to successfully scrape, collect, and analyse the data from the websites related to Mars. 
    We found valuable data about the Martian temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and months/days.
